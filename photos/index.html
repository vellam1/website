    Covid Lockdown Comforts

    Covid lockdowns have been rough, and we've all needed things to distract
    ourselves from the fact that we're all stuck inside, and can't see our
    friends or go out and see the world. I'm lucky that I've had a
    partner by my side through all of it, but I've also needed some creature
    comforts, like my record player to make it through. This series aims to show
    what lockdown is like, and how I've tried to get through it, with piles
    of records, and long naps. I used all natural lighting for this series, and
    often made the photos feel warmer. For framing I used various techiques to
    get interesting shots. I also originally tried to go to grazeland to attempt
    to get a series of photos, but I felt it was too staged, so went back to
    the drawing board. I tried to either take photos candidly, or make them look
    as natural as possible.
